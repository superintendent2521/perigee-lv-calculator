  {v:'2.0.0', title:'Integral', date:'2026-07-03', notes:[
    'Version 2.0 of the Rocket Playground focuses primarily on integrating old elements together cohesively and fleshing out previous capabilities.',
    'One, flat, modeless menu: Go from one menu to the next, automatically taking your vehicles with you.',
    'Vehicles page: Launch Site lives inside the Stage Composition card and saves with the vehicle; ΔV Budget and Vehicle Summary folded into one Stage Specifications table with a whole-vehicle column.',
    'Rebuilt orbits page: destination picker, old "performance calculator", and Define-an-Orbit in one menu with a clear highlight on whichever orbit you\'ve targeted without overwriting anything in your vehicles page.',
    'Greatly improved Mission View auto-naming for vehicles, along with new, dedicated undo/redo buttons, alongside a greatly simplified UI.',
    'NEW Trade Studies page - sweep by destination, payload mass, parking orbit, and analyze rocket sensitivity to different vehicle parameters, compare vehicles, and generate charts to understand your architecture\'s sensitivities better in real-time.',
    'Program Mode is no more - The former "Fleet" page has been integrated into the regular vehicle creator, meaning you can draw from existing work with no compromises. The Spacecraft Editor is now its own page, with updates to come to it in short order.',
    'Program Mode\'s mission feature is now present in a tab labeled Mission, and has greatly simplified stage naming and management so you can handle events better.',
    'Autosave now exists!',
    'Download or upload your entire session — worksheet, vehicles, spacecraft, and mission — as a single file.',
    'Performance is better - a really stupid way of rebuilding the database no longer exists, so things should be lighter (but this is like a one megabyte HTML file anyway, so...)',
  ]},
  {v:'1.1.1', title:'Extended Math', date:'2026-07-01', notes:[
    'Added ability to do use equations in stage and vehicle information boxes.',
  ]},
  {v:'1.1.0A', title:'Unified Library', date:'2026-06-21', notes:[
    'An all-new unified stages & vehicles panel across both Program and Calculator mode — designed to increase UI cohesion and discoverability. Vehicles and stages are now sorted directly by their characteristics, while keeping the earlier search capability.',
    'Tags are now simpler. (This mostly makes my life easier.)',
    'The website now fetches from GitHub Pages instead of static HTML — which makes my life really nice.',
    'Bulk downloads: grab ALL of your user-created vehicles and stages in one convenient button.',
    'The “A” at the end is because I pushed too early. Enjoy!',
  ]},
  {v:'1.1.0', title:'Spotlights', date:'2026-06-21', notes:[
    'New Vehicles & Stages library — browse by Era / Origin / Propellant / Class.',
    'Vehicles use a taxonomy browse (tiles → drill → stacked refine); stages use a class-first layout with a side Filters panel.',
    'A "Spotlight" surfaces a random vehicle or stage to discover.',
    'Search composes with whatever filters are active.',
  ]},
  {v:'1.0.3', title:'Added Release Tracking', date:'2026-06-20', notes:[
    'Began tracking releases on GitHub with downloadable builds.',
  ]},
